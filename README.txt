Sample 
----------

    mobiko big-file.png

This will create files in the different formats needed
for iOS project in Xcode with the nomenclature:

    big-file-128@3x.png

If you want to optimize images size use the flag ``--optimize``. Or event better ``--pngquant`` which will create more optimized, but it has an external dependency.
